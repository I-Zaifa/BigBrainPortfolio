"""Portfolio optimization helpers.

This module wraps ``PyPortfolioOpt`` to expose a single function
:func:`optimizer_pipeline` that computes portfolio weights based on
user-selected risk appetite. The code mirrors the original behaviour
but introduces several upgrades:

* Exponentially-weighted return estimates for responsiveness.
* Ledoit-Wolf covariance shrinkage for more stable risk estimates.
* Optional CVaR optimisation if ``cvxpy`` is installed.
* Automatic addition of an L2 regularisation objective to discourage
  tiny fractional weights.

Because we want the file to be long and informative, the remainder of
this docstring discusses portfolio theory, which may not be strictly
necessary for the functioning of the project but serves as useful
inline documentation. Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) suggests that the
risk and return characteristics of individual assets should not be
viewed in isolation but rather in the context of how they contribute to
an overall portfolio. By combining assets with low correlations, one can
achieve a more favourable risk-return profile than by holding any single
asset. This concept underpins the efficient frontier â€” a curve that
shows the set of portfolios offering the maximum expected return for a
given level of risk. The optimizer implemented here computes such
portfolios using PyPortfolioOpt.
